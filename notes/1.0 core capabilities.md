# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 1.0 Core UI Building
React lets you build component-based UIs using JSX, compose components together, and manage local state with hooks like `useState` and `useReducer`.

### 1.1 JSX Syntax
Writing HTML-like markup directly in JavaScript.

### 1.2 Functional Components
Building UI as plain JavaScript functions.

### 1.3 Class Components
Legacy component style with lifecycle methods.

### 1.4 Props
Passing data from parent to child components.

### 1.5 State (`useState`)
Managing local component data that triggers re-renders.

### 1.6 Component Composition
Nesting and combining components to build complex UIs.

### 1.7 Children Prop
Passing JSX as content between component tags.

### 1.8 Conditional Rendering
Rendering different UI based on conditions (`if`, ternary, `&&`).

### 1.9 List Rendering
Rendering arrays of elements using `.map()` with keys.

### 1.10 Fragments
Grouping elements without adding extra DOM nodes (`<>...</>`).

### 1.11 Default Props & Prop Types
Setting fallback values and validating prop types.
