# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 6.0 Concurrent Features
React's concurrent mode allows it to pause, resume, and prioritize rendering work. This powers `Suspense` for lazy loading and data fetching, and `useTransition` for smooth UI updates.

### 6.1 Concurrent Mode
Allows React to pause, resume, and prioritize rendering work for a smoother UI.

### 6.2 `useTransition`
Marks updates as non-urgent so React can keep the UI interactive during heavy renders.

### 6.3 `useDeferredValue`
Defers a value update until the browser is idle, preventing UI lag.

### 6.4 Suspense
Declaratively waits for async content like lazy components or data before rendering.

### 6.5 Automatic Batching
React 19 automatically batches multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance.

### 6.6 `startTransition`
Wraps non-urgent updates outside of hooks to keep the UI responsive.

### 6.7 Selective Hydration
Hydrates parts of the server-rendered page incrementally based on user interaction priority.

### 6.8 Time Slicing
Breaks rendering work into small chunks so the browser can handle high-priority tasks in between.
