# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 9.0 Error Handling
Error Boundaries catch rendering errors in subtrees. React 19 added improved error reporting and new hooks like `useOptimistic` for optimistic UI updates.

### 9.1 Error Boundaries
Class components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI.

### 9.2 `getDerivedStateFromError`
A static lifecycle method used inside Error Boundaries to update state and render a fallback UI after an error.

### 9.3 `componentDidCatch`
A lifecycle method for logging error details to an error reporting service.

### 9.4 Fallback UI
A user-friendly interface displayed in place of a crashed component tree.

### 9.5 Error Recovery
Allowing users to retry or reset after an error using state resets inside Error Boundaries.

### 9.6 Improved Error Reporting (React 19)
React 19 provides clearer, more actionable error messages and better distinction between client and server errors.

### 9.7 `useOptimistic`
Displays an optimistic state update immediately while an async operation is in progress, reverting if it fails.

### 9.8 Try/Catch in Event Handlers
Using standard JavaScript try/catch blocks to handle errors in async functions and event handlers outside of render.
