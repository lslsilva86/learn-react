# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 14.0 Routing

### 14.1 React Router Basics
The de facto routing library for React; enables client-side navigation without full page reloads.

### 14.2 `BrowserRouter` & `HashRouter`
Top-level providers that supply routing context; `BrowserRouter` uses the HTML5 history API, `HashRouter` uses URL hashes.

### 14.3 `Route` & `Routes`
Declaratively mapping URL paths to components; `Routes` renders only the first matching `Route`.

### 14.4 `Link` & `NavLink`
Navigation components that replace anchor tags; `NavLink` adds active styling to the current route.

### 14.5 URL Parameters (`useParams`)
Extracting dynamic segments from the URL such as `/product/:id` into component logic.

### 14.6 Query Strings (`useSearchParams`)
Reading and updating URL query parameters like `?sort=asc&page=2` from within components.

### 14.7 Programmatic Navigation (`useNavigate`)
Redirecting users to a different route imperatively in response to events like form submissions.

### 14.8 Nested Routes
Rendering child routes inside parent layouts, enabling shared UI across multiple pages.

### 14.9 Protected / Private Routes
Guarding routes behind authentication checks and redirecting unauthenticated users.

### 14.10 Layouts with Shared UI
Using parent routes with `<Outlet>` to share headers, sidebars, and footers across pages.

### 14.11 Lazy Loading Routes (`React.lazy` + `Suspense`)
Dynamically importing route components to reduce initial bundle size and speed up load time.
