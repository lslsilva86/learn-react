# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 3.0 State Management
Built-in hooks cover most needs: `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`. For global state, you can integrate libraries like Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or Recoil.

### 3.1 `useState`
Managing simple local component state.

### 3.2 `useReducer`
Handling complex state logic with a reducer function.

### 3.3 `useContext`
Sharing state across components without prop drilling.

### 3.4 Context API
Creating and providing global state accessible to any component in the tree.

### 3.5 Redux
Popular external library for predictable, centralized state management.

### 3.6 Zustand
Lightweight external state management with a simple API.

### 3.7 Jotai
Atomic state management for fine-grained reactivity.

### 3.8 Recoil
Facebook's atom-based state management library for React.

### 3.9 React Query / TanStack Query
Server state management; handling fetching, caching, and syncing remote data.

### 3.10 Lifting State Up
Moving state to a common ancestor to share between sibling components.

### 3.11 Derived State
Computing values from existing state rather than storing redundant data.


> In short, React is primarily a UI rendering library, but its ecosystem and React 19's new primitives push it closer to a full-stack framework primitive — especially when paired with a meta-framework like Next.js.
