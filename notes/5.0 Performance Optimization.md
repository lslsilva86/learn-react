# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 5.0 Performance Optimization
`useMemo` and `useCallback` memoize values and functions. `React.memo` prevents unnecessary re-renders. The React Compiler (introduced experimentally in React 19) can auto-memoize components. `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` let you mark updates as non-urgent to keep the UI responsive.

### 5.1 `useMemo`
Memoizes expensive computed values so they are only recalculated when dependencies change.

### 5.2 `useCallback`
Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creation on every render.

### 5.3 `React.memo`
Wraps a component to prevent re-rendering if its props haven't changed.

### 5.4 `useTransition`
Marks state updates as non-urgent, keeping the UI responsive during heavy renders.

### 5.5 `useDeferredValue`
Defers updating a value until more urgent updates have been processed.

### 5.6 React Compiler
Experimentally introduced in React 19 to auto-memoize components and eliminate manual optimization.

### 5.7 Code Splitting
Breaking the app bundle into smaller chunks loaded on demand to reduce initial load time.

### 5.8 Virtualization
Rendering only visible items in large lists using libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtual`.

### 5.9 Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders
Structuring state and props carefully to minimize the number of components that re-render.

### 5.10 Profiler API
Built-in `<Profiler>` component for measuring rendering performance of parts of the component tree.
