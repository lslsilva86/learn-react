# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 10.0 Portals
`ReactDOM.createPortal` lets you render children into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy — useful for modals and tooltips.

### 10.1 `ReactDOM.createPortal`
Renders a component's children into a different DOM node outside the parent component tree.

### 10.2 Modals & Dialogs
Using portals to render modal windows at the top level of the DOM, avoiding z-index and overflow issues.

### 10.3 Tooltips & Popovers
Rendering floating UI elements like tooltips outside their parent container to avoid clipping.

### 10.4 Notifications & Toasts
Mounting notification components at the root DOM level for consistent positioning across the app.

### 10.5 Event Bubbling Through Portals
Events fired inside a portal still bubble up through the React component tree, not the DOM tree.

### 10.6 Dropdown Menus
Rendering dropdowns outside overflow-hidden containers using portals to ensure correct visibility.
