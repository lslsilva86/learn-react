# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 2.0 Rendering
It supports client-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) — typically via frameworks like Next.js or Remix. React 19 also introduced improved support for React Server Components (RSC), letting you render components entirely on the server with zero client-side JS.

### 2.1 Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Rendering the UI entirely in the browser using JavaScript.

### 2.2 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Generating HTML on the server per request for faster initial load and better SEO.

### 2.3 Static Site Generation (SSG)
Pre-rendering pages at build time for maximum performance, typically via Next.js or Remix.

### 2.4 React Server Components (RSC)
Rendering components entirely on the server with zero client-side JavaScript, introduced in React 19.

### 2.5 Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Updating static pages after build time without rebuilding the entire site (via Next.js).

### 2.6 Hydration
Attaching React's event listeners to server-rendered HTML on the client side.

### 2.7 Streaming SSR
Sending HTML to the browser in chunks as it's generated, reducing time to first byte.

### 2.8 Lazy Loading (`React.lazy`)
Dynamically importing components only when they are needed, reducing initial bundle size.

### 2.9 Suspense
Declaratively handling loading states while waiting for components or data to be ready.
