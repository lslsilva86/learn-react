# What React Can Do (React 19)

## Refs & DOM Access
`useRef` gives you direct DOM access or a mutable container. React 19 simplified ref handling — you can now pass `ref` as a regular prop instead of needing `forwardRef`.

### 8.1 `useRef`
Creates a mutable reference that persists across renders without triggering re-renders.

### 8.2 Direct DOM Access
Attaching a ref to a DOM element to directly read or manipulate it (e.g. focusing an input).

### 8.3 `forwardRef`
Forwards a ref from a parent component down to a child DOM element (legacy pattern, simplified in React 19).

### 8.4 `ref` as a Prop (React 19)
React 19 allows passing `ref` directly as a regular prop, removing the need for `forwardRef`.

### 8.5 `useImperativeHandle`
Customizes the instance value exposed when a parent accesses a child's ref.

### 8.6 Callback Refs
Using a function instead of a ref object to get notified when a DOM node is attached or detached.

### 8.7 Storing Mutable Values
Using `useRef` to store any mutable value that should persist across renders without causing re-renders.
