# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 4.0 Side Effects & Lifecycle
`useEffect` handles side effects. `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after DOM mutations. `useInsertionEffect` is for CSS-in-JS libraries.

### 4.1 `useEffect`
Runs side effects after render, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM.

### 4.2 `useLayoutEffect`
Runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before the browser paints — useful for measuring layout.

### 4.3 `useInsertionEffect`
Designed for CSS-in-JS libraries to inject styles before any DOM mutations occur.

### 4.4 Mounting
The phase when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM.

### 4.5 Updating
The phase when a component re-renders due to state or prop changes.

### 4.6 Unmounting
The phase when a component is removed from the DOM; cleanup logic runs here.

### 4.7 Cleanup Functions
Returning a function from `useEffect` to cancel subscriptions, timers, or event listeners on unmount.

### 4.8 Dependency Array
Controlling when an effect re-runs by specifying which values it depends on.

### 4.9 `componentDidMount` / `componentDidUpdate` / `componentWillUnmount`
Class component lifecycle methods — equivalent to `useEffect` patterns in functional components.
