# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 11.0 Animations
React integrates well with Framer Motion, React Spring, and CSS transitions. No built-in animation system, but the architecture supports it cleanly.

### 11.1 CSS Transitions & Animations
Using standard CSS `transition` and `animation` properties toggled via React state changes.

### 11.2 Framer Motion
Popular React animation library for declarative, physics-based animations and gestures.

### 11.3 React Spring
Animation library based on spring-physics for natural, fluid motion.

### 11.4 React Transition Group
A low-level library for managing component enter/exit transitions in the DOM.

### 11.5 `useAnimationFrame`
Using `requestAnimationFrame` inside a custom hook for frame-by-frame animation control.

### 11.6 Layout Animations
Animating changes in component size or position automatically using libraries like Framer Motion's layout prop.

### 11.7 Gesture Animations
Handling drag, swipe, hover, and tap gestures tied to animations using libraries like Framer Motion.

### 11.8 Staggered Animations
Animating lists of items with a delay between each element for a cascading effect.

### 11.9 Page Transitions
Animating between route changes for a smooth navigation experience.
