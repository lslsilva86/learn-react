# What React Can Do (React 19)

## 7.0 Data Fetching (React 19)
React 19 introduced the `use()` hook, which lets you read promises and context directly in render. It also introduced built-in support for `<form>` actions and server actions (via frameworks), making form handling and mutations much simpler.

### 7.1 `use()` Hook
Reads promises and context directly inside render, simplifying async data handling in React 19.

### 7.2 `useEffect` for Fetching
Traditional approach to fetch data on mount or when dependencies change.

### 7.3 Server Actions
Functions that run on the server, triggered from the client — introduced natively in React 19 via frameworks like Next.js.

### 7.4 Form Actions
Built-in support for `<form>` actions in React 19, making form submissions and mutations simpler without extra event handlers.

### 7.5 TanStack Query (React Query)
Popular external library for fetching, caching, syncing, and updating server state.

### 7.6 SWR
Lightweight data fetching library by Vercel with stale-while-revalidate caching strategy.

### 7.7 `useOptimistic`
New React 19 hook for showing optimistic UI updates immediately while an async operation is in progress.

### 7.8 Suspense for Data Fetching
Integrates with async data sources to show fallback UI while data is loading.

### 7.9 Streaming Data
Progressively streaming data from server to client using React Server Components and Suspense boundaries.
